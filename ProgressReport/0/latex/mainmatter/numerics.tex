\section{Numerical Methods}


Solution of fluid flow domain has a complex physical and mathematical examinations. 4 methods are commonly preferred to approximate exact solutions of governing  equations. These methods are;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Traveling Wave Method
	\item Helmholtz Finite Difference Method
	\item Helmholtz Finite Element Method
	\item Galerkin Method
\end{itemize}

Each method has been used to solve thermoacoustic governing equations mentioned in previous section. Equation \ref{eq:nondim1} and \ref{eq:nondim2} are determined by applying these methods.
