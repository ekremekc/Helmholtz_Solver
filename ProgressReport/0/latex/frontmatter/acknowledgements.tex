 First and foremost, I would like to thank my Allah, who is the most merciful and most compassionate. Without his help and mercy, I was not able to succeed my studies, my journey.\\

 \noindent I would like to continue by thanking my supervisor Dr Jason Stafford for his mentorship and his sincerity.\\
 
 \noindent I would also like to extend my thanks to Turkish government. Without their support and trust, these studies would not be possible. 	\\
 
 \noindent I would also like to express my big thanks to my friends of Ahmet Alperen Koç and Tuğberk Hakan Çetin for their encouragements and supports during my life regardless of good or bad day.\\
 
 \noindent I would also like to convey my thanks to Usamah Choudhary who helped me to overcome the difficulties during my first year in foreign country.\\
 
 \noindent Finally, I would like to say my big appreciations for my dad, mum, brother and sister to fulfil my dreams through this challenging period.\\
