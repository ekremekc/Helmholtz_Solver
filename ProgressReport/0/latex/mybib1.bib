	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to discuss the development of new contours of axisymmetric supersonic nozzles giving a uniform and parallel flow at the exit section, to improve the aerodynamic performances compared to the minimum length nozzle, by increasing the exit Mach number and the thrust coefficient, and by reduction of the nozzle's mass, while holding the same throat section between the two nozzles. The new nozzle is named the best performance nozzle. Its form contains a cylindrical central body and an external wall for the flow redress. The study is done at high temperature, lower than the dissociation threshold of the molecules. The variation of the specific heats with the temperature is considered. The design is made by the method of characteristics. The predictor-corrector algorithm is used to make the numerical resolution of the obtained nonlinear algebraic equations. The validation of results is made by the convergence of the numerical critical sections ratio with that given by the theory. The comparison of the results is made with the minimum length nozzle since it is currently used in the aerospace propulsion. The design depends on ME, T0, ybody, y*, and the mesh generation. The application is done with air. A computational fluid dynamics verification for the under nozzle expressed regime has shown that a flow separation with the wall is observed because of the side-loads, which are reduced for this new nozzle compared to the minimum length nozzle.},

The scheme uses curvilinear coordinates and a composite low-high-order treatment with the normalized variable diagram as limiter for the convective terms. The Cartesian components of the velocity are used as dependent Ivariables in the momentum equations and the extension of the SIMPLE method to include the compressibility effects is presented for a non-staggered grid arrangement. Comparison of the calculations with available numerical and experimental data shows that the method is accurate, self-adaptive and stable for a wide range of Mach numbers. The shock resolution is noticeably improved by using a high-order scheme for the convective term treatment. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A large portion of the wet and dry mass budget in any space system is assigned to the propulsion system. Each of these depends on the engine system design values. Any effort to decrease the mass of space systems demands an additional effort to reduce the propulsion system mass, which in turn requires a complete review of the engine design. Thus, proposing a computational model derived from the engine design and based on minimum system mass is necessary. The present computational research developed a propulsion system design strategy for liquid propulsion systems to optimize take-off mass and satisfy the thrust required under performance and structural constraints. Improvement of the geometric and performance variables and component mass using a mass-based model for optimization process is investigated. The method uses a hybrid genetic algorithm sequential quadratic programming as an optimizer. The mass-based formulation problem is solved using a hybrid optimization algorithm with a genetic algorithm as the global optimizer and sequential quadratic programming as the local optimizer starting from the solution given by the genetic algorithm. The convergence of the optimization algorithm is improved by introducing an initial solution based on genetic algorithm. Comparison of the proposed design optimization model with a real space propulsion system indicates that the performance of the proposed algorithm significantly improved the final results. While propellant mass, engine consumption rate and engine geometric dimensions decreased, specific impulse increased. All of these decreased the total mass of the space propulsion system.},
